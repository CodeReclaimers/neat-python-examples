# neat-python-examples

This repository previously contained examples for the neat-python library which have dependencies beyond the Python 
standard library and neat-python.  These examples have since been moved into the main repository.

You can find the current examples at [neat-python/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python/tree/master/examples)
