"""
A parallel version of XOR using neat.parallel.

Since XOR is a simple experiment, a parallel version probably won't run any
faster than the single-process version, due to the overhead of
inter-process communication.

If your evaluation function is what's taking up most of your processing time
(and you should probably check by using a profiler while running
single-process), you should see a significant performance improvement by
evaluating in parallel.

This example is only intended to show how to do a parallel experiment
in neat-python.  You can of course roll your own parallelism mechanism
or inherit from ParallelEvaluator if you need to do something more complicated.
